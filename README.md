### Date: July 19, 2016


##### What I did accomplish:
- Everything in requirement spec in both p1 and p2.


##### Extra Credit:
- I made my note more stylish.
- Notes are resizable.


### Update:
- I fixed the position: absolute.
- Snap to grid.
- For extra credit, I added zIndex sorting. And when I drag a note, it goes above all other notes.
